### **Introducing: memeMATIC.io**

Do you have annoying airdropped NFTs & shitCOINs trapped in your wallet? Malicious ones even maybe? 
These tokens will never go away and in fact, some of these tokens, if you interact with them run the risk of depleting the hard-earned assets in your wallet completely. 

A primary goal of memeMATIC will be the development of a _user friendly_ Web3 dApp DEX swap platform that will facilitate the safe removal of scam tokens, spam airdrop tokens, & shitCOINs via our own **memeMATIC (mMATIC)** tokens. 
A percentage of each transaction shall pay for the gas fee and transaction fee in **mMATIC** 
Originally, mMATIC was planned to be paired with _RadioShack's_ **RADIO** token on Polygon but now it is apparent that this specific pairing will lack the liquidity we had once planned. 

We shall operate and act as a community driven organization and aim to become fully supported by the community. 
The founders at Advanced Divergent Human Development _(ADHD)_ envision the convergence of both Human & AI for a _true_DAO_ to function at maximum effectiveness. This Advanced Divergent Human DAO will decide policy, change, & most importantly to vote on the reimbursement for loss of assets to victims of scams and/or outright theft. This would be a community controlled treasury funded by the community, donations, and percentage from our swap. There would be an application and vetting process involved in the reimbursement and withdrawal from the treasury.
Our goal is to remove scam and spam token contracts from victimâ€™s wallets to eliminate the  and the blockchains themselves and the establishment of a community operated DAO and treasury for the Web3 community. 

This is the concept of a DeFi-DAO Insurance liquidity pool where anons can make claims for reimbursement of losses due to fraud, scams, and/or theft. The community votes to decide via holding governance/utility token **memeMATIC (mMATIC)**

### **Introducing: DeFi Insurance**

Our **mMATIC** tokens will gain their value from the utility that they provide (Utility/Governance Token) and from the support of our community. Our community will want to support the project, as we do them, and we will make sure that our project will qualify for grants/support from network chains (Polygon), companies, other communities, and government funding that does not affect the policies of our DAO.You can use our Swap to swap shitcoins of zero value for our tokens (**mMATIC**) in return. There will be a percentage system in place for conversion of valueless tokens just like for those with value. There will be a listing of accepted shitcoins available for swap. We will then be able to add liquidity, staking pools, and beyond with swapped tokens of greater values.

### **Introducing: Scam Network; Ensnare & Kill (SnEk)**

We will need to have our own node network (SnEk) that will store the shitcoins and pay for gas while the shitcoins are either burned or entrapped in our sacrificial martyr murder wallets. Our nodes will be miners/validators to subsidize the gas fees involved in this process.

I feel that we will inevitably earn the respect and support from the web3 communities.
